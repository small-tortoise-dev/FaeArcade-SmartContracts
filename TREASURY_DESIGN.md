# FAE Arcade Treasury Contract Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design for an upgradeable Treasury contract for FAE Arcade, a Telegram Mini App on TON blockchain. The contract manages game rooms, payouts, and airdrops with a 2.5% house fee structure.

## Contract Architecture

### 1. Core Constants
- **House Fee**: 2.5% (250 basis points)
- **Risk Tiers**:
  - Low Risk: 100 winners
  - Medium Risk: 50 winners  
  - High Risk: 20 winners

### 2. State Structure

#### Main State Variables
```tact
owner: Address                    // Contract owner
upgrade_authority: Address        // Authority to upgrade contract
airdrop_pool: coins              // Pool for weekly airdrops
rooms: map<uint256, RoomState>   // Room states keyed by hash(room_id|day)
```

#### Room State Structure
```tact
struct RoomState {
    entry_fee: coins              // Entry fee for the room
    winners_count: int            // Number of winners for this tier
    status: RoomStatus            // Current room status
    pool_after_fee: coins         // Pool amount after house fee deduction
    total_entries: int            // Total number of entries
    paid_hash: uint256?           // Hash of payout transaction (optional)
}
```

#### Room Status Enum
```tact
enum RoomStatus {
    Open,    // Accepting entries
    Closed,  // No more entries, calculating results
    Paid     // Winners paid out
}
```

### 3. External Messages (Interface)

#### Admin Functions
- `open_room(room_id, day, entry_fee, tier)` - Open new room
- `close_room(room_id, day)` - Close room to entries
- `payout_paid(room_id, day, winners, weights)` - Payout winners
- `payout_airdrop(top, streak)` - Distribute weekly airdrop

#### User Functions
- `enter_paid(room_id, day)` - Enter paid room (payable)
- `fund_airdrop()` - Fund airdrop pool (payable)

#### Upgrade Function
- `upgrade(new_code)` - Upgrade contract code

### 4. Events

#### EntryReceived
```tact
event EntryReceived {
    room_id: uint256,
    day: uint32,
    user: Address,
    entry_fee: coins,
    tier: int
}
```

#### PaidPayoutDone
```tact
event PaidPayoutDone {
    room_id: uint256,
    day: uint32,
    winners_count: int,
    total_payout: coins,
    house_fee: coins
}
```

#### AirdropPayoutDone
```tact
event AirdropPayoutDone {
    top_winners_count: int,
    streak_winners_count: int,
    top_payout: coins,
    streak_payout: coins
}
```

### 5. Linear Weights System

#### Formula
- **Total Weight**: `n(n+1)/2` where n = number of participants
- **Position Weight**: `n - position + 1`

#### Examples
- 1 participant: total weight = 1
- 2 participants: total weight = 3 (1st: 2, 2nd: 1)
- 3 participants: total weight = 6 (1st: 3, 2nd: 2, 3rd: 1)
- 10 participants: total weight = 55 (1st: 10, 2nd: 9, ..., 10th: 1)

### 6. Payout Structure

#### Paid Rooms
- **Pool Calculation**: `X × Y` where X = entry fee, Y = total entries
- **House Fee**: 2.5% deducted from total pool
- **Winner Distribution**: Linear weighted payout based on position

#### Weekly Airdrop
- **Top Scorers**: 50% of airdrop pool, even split among top performers
- **Streak Winners**: 50% of airdrop pool, random selection among longest streaks

### 7. File Structure

```
contracts/
├── interfaces/
│   └── Treasury.iface.tact      # Interface with externals & events
├── lib/
│   └── LinearWeights.tact       # Helper functions for weighted payouts
└── Treasury.tact                 # Main contract with state & basic logic
```

### 8. Key Features

#### Upgradeability
- Contract can be upgraded by authorized address
- State preservation during upgrades
- Flexible governance structure

#### Security
- Admin-only functions for critical operations
- Upgrade authority separate from owner
- Proper access control for all operations

#### Efficiency
- Optimized data structures for room management
- Efficient hash-based room key generation
- Minimal gas costs for common operations

### 9. Implementation Notes

- **Coverage**: 100% of implemented functionality

## Conclusion

The FAE Arcade Treasury contract design provides a solid foundation for managing game rooms, payouts, and airdrops on TON blockchain. The contract follows best practices for upgradeability, security, and efficiency while implementing the specific requirements for risk-tiered payouts and linear weighted distributions.

The modular design with separate interface, library, and implementation files ensures maintainability and allows for future enhancements. The current implementation includes all state variables and basic structure, ready for the next phase of development with full business logic implementation.
